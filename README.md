This is a temporary resource for the Angular Schema Form codebase, until a new offical release is issued. This repo contains an unpublished fix to remove a deprecated call between Schema Form and Angualr. 

It is to be replaced with a release from here when available: https://github.com/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form/releases
